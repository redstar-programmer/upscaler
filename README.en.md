## üëã Introduction
**redstar upscaler is a Python-based GUI tool to automatically upscale videos to higher resolutions using `ffmpeg`, `Real-ESRGAN`, and `Flowframes`.

- Extract video frames ‚Üí upscale ‚Üí merge videos in one step
- Supports various realesrgan models
- Optional interpolation via Flowframes
- Automatic extraction and processing of audio codecs
- Work on source location or specified path

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Developed and tested in a Windows environment.

Below is a simple usage demo:<br>
![ÎØ∏ÎîîÏñ¥1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba601a08-6749-45fd-ae21-f1a2a52987f6)

## üíæ Installation and Preparation

1. install and locate the following external tools (note that the distribution file includes ffmpeg, Real-ESRGAN, and Flowframes installers (see Programs folder in the path))
   - [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   - [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases)
   - [Flowframes](https://github.com/n00mkrad/flowframes) *(optional)
2. unzip and run readstar's upscaler.exe
3. in the case of Flowframes, the models loaded may be different depending on your environment, so be sure to run Flowframes and make sure that the Interpolation AI and AI Model in the Interpolation tab match the version of redstar upscaler's resources/flowframes_models.ini. <br>Comment out the models that are not loaded by marking them with # and make sure that the order of models in redstar upscaler's settings window matches the order of models in <br>Flowframes.

<br><br>
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4898904a-bb23-4dba-997d-23ca744fed93)
- Monitor the overall progress of the upscale job
- ‚úÖ Check upscale logging (log files are created by date in the log folder in the live folder)
- Automatically organize deliverables after job completion (prefixed with [REDSTAR])
- ‚úÖ Configurable action after task completion<br>( Do nothing / Close program / Sleep mode / Hibernate mode / Close window)
<br><br>
## üöÄ How to use (Quick Start)

1. add video files (MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, FLV, WMV, MPG, WEBM, 3GP, OGV supported)
2. specify the working location or check "Use original file path"
3. click "Settings" button on the added video
4. ffmpeg, realESRGAN, Flowframes detailed settings
5. click Batch apply to all files / Apply to selected files only
6. click "Confirm" button
7. check the commands to be executed and click the Start Task button

> ‚ú® The result of the job will be two files: upscaled video and frame interpolated video in the selected folder.
> ‚ú® The completed files will be saved with a filename prefixed with [REDSTAR].
